                <h3>About Us</h3>
                <p>Chemistry is a branch of science that involves the study of the composition, structure and properties of matter. Often known as the central science, it is a creative discipline chiefly concerned with atomic and molecular structure and its change, for instance through chemical reactions.</p>

                <img src="./image1.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Science is the pursuit and application of knowledge and understanding of the natural and social world following a systematic methodology based on evidence. Scientific methodology includes the following: ... Evidence. Experiment and/or observation as benchmarks for testing hypotheses.</p>

                <p>A microscope is an instrument that is used to magnify small objects. Some microscopes can even be used to observe an object at the cellular level, allowing scientists to see the shape of a cell, its nucleus, mitochondria, and other organelles</p>

                <img src="./image3.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Measurement is the quantification of attributes of an object or event, which can be used to compare with other objects or events. ... This system reduces all physical measurements to a mathematical combination of seven base units. The science of measurement is pursued in the field of metrology.</p>

                <a href="#">FLASK</a>
                <img src="./image4.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Flask is an API of Python that allows us to build up web-applications. It was developed by Armin Ronacher. Flask's framework is more explicit than Django's framework and is also easier to learn because it has less base code to implement a simple web-Application</p>
