Often known as the central science, it is a creative discipline chiefly concerned with atomic and molecular structure and its change, for instance through chemical reactions.</p>

            <p>Measurement is the quantification of attributes of an object or event, which can be used to compare with other objects or events. ... This system reduces all physical measurements to a mathematical combination of seven base units. The science of measurement is pursued in the field of metrology.</p>

            <a href="#">FLASK</a>
            <p>Flask is an API of Python that allows us to build up web-applications. It was developed by Armin Ronacher. Flask's framework is more explicit than Django's framework and is also easier to learn because it has less base code to implement a simple web-Application</p>
